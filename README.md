# GitHub Tools

This is my collection of tools and experiments with the GitHub APIs. Currently,
any requests are hard coded for my GitHub user id.

## Ideas

- Clicking refresh should update the sort order of the repo list.
- Add authentication and dynamically set the user for all features.
- Add a column to Repo list for security audit alerts.
- Add a column for link to the repo web url to the Repo list.
- Use electron instead of web browser for UI.
